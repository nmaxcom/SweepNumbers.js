# SweepNumbers.js (Alpha, paused dev due to time constraints)
A micro library to change the number values in the DOM by sweeping them left or right. Or clicking on the number! It has various nifty options.

Notice: I'm converting it to a react component; basically starting from scratch...

### Development
Everything is set to go to develop on SweepNumbers.js without pain:

1. Clone this repo: `git clone git@github.com:nmaxcom/SweepNumbers.js.git`
2. Change into your new directory and make sure you are not missing anything: `npm install`

That's it. If you run `gulp` from the terminal, your browser will load the html with a couple of examples. Every change you make on `examples.html` itself or `SweepNumbers.js`, the browser will insta-reload.

Seconds after running `gulp`, should load http://localhost:3000/examples.html where you'll see how awesome is SweepNumbers.js by itself and with your changes.

Ideas, pull requests and witty insults are 100% welcome!

Happy hacking.
